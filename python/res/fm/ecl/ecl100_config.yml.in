# NB: There are inter related dependencies between this file, the EclConfig
#     class which essentially internalizes this file and the EclRun class
#     which uses the EclConfig class.
#
# The information about an eclipse installation at a particular site is
# stored in one such configuration file. The file has only one required
# top level element: 'simulators' which describe the various simulators
# which are installed. In additon you can optionally have a top level
# element 'env' which is a dictionary representing environment variables
# which should be set before the simulator starts.

# The 'simulators' setting is a dictionary where the keys are the available
# simulators. In the example below we have the simulators 'ecl100' and 'flow'.
# Observe that the names 'flow' and 'ecl100' will be used as keys in the EclRun
# class, i.e. these are *not* arbitrary strings.
#
# Each simulator can be installed in multiple versions, in the example below the
# ecl100 simulator is installed in versions '2015.2' and '2017.2' whereas flow
# is only installed in version '2018.04'. These version strings will be passed
# as argv[1] when instantiating a EclRun instance.
#
# Finally each version of the programs can exist as a scalar single process
# application and a parallell MPI application. When we have drilled all the way
# down through simulators['ecl100']['2105.2']['scalar'] the only required
# attribute is 'executable' which is the full path to the executable program. In
# addition you can add an env: setting which will be a dictionary of environment
# variables which will be set before the simulator is invoked. The 2015.2 mpi
# version of ecl100 and the 2018.04 scalar version of flow have examples of
# shuch env settings.
#
# If it is an MPI simulation you must in addition to the executable attribute
# also set an 'mpirun' attribute.

# You can have a shared 'env' attribute which is an environment variable map

# the simulator as well they will be merged with these common settings, the
